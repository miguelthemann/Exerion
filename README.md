**Exerion** is an expansive industrial technology mod for Minecraft designed to bridge the gap between primitive survival mechanics and futuristic cybernetic automation. 

Instead of unlocking all high-tech machines instantaneously, **Exerion introduces a structured 10-Era Technological Progression System**, combining physical kinetic torque, explosive steam thermodynamics, and advanced electrical grids.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- **10 Evolving Civilizational Eras:** Advance through Stone, Copper, Iron, Mechanical, Steel/Steam, Industrial, Digital, Advanced, Quantum, and Cosmic tiers.
- **Dynamic Era Gating:** Advanced blocks and items are protected from being broken, used, or exploited until players legitimately unlock their required technological tier.
- **Dual Mod Loader Compatibility:** Fully supported on both **Fabric** (via Fabric Loom) and **NeoForge**.
- **Three Interdependent Energy Grids:**
  - 🔄 **Kinetic Torque:** Driven by Water Wheels and Hand Cranks through transmission shafts.
  - 💨 **High-Pressure Steam:** Generated in Coal Boilers (with realistic explosion risks!) to drive high-RPM Steam Turbines.
  - ⚡ **Electrical Units (EU):** Solid fuel generators, geothermal converters, and photovoltaic solar arrays powering high-speed factory lines.
- **Ore Doubling & Metallurgy:** Manual and electric crushers double ore yields with a $25\%$ bonus byproduct chance; gear presses efficiently shape plates and mechanical components.
- **Quantum & Digital Storage:** Wireless cross-dimensional Frequency Ender Chests and unified Digital Storage Terminals.
- **In-Game Guidebook & Scanner:** In-game encyclopedia book and portable Era Scanner.

## ⚡ Power & Energy Systems

### 1. Rotational / Kinetic Power
- **Water Wheels** and **Hand Cranks** feed rotational force into connected **Mechanical Shafts**.
- Drives the **Gear Press** (doubles plate and gear crafting efficiency) and the **Manual Crusher** (ore doubling with a $25\%$ bonus byproduct dust chance).

### 2. Steam Thermodynamics
- The **Coal Boiler** boils water into condensed **Steam Crystals**.
- > [!CAUTION] Explosion Hazard
  > Running a heated boiler without water results in an instant catastrophic explosion. Always verify water levels before loading fuel!
- The **Steam Turbine** converts steam crystals into simultaneous mechanical torque and electrical current.

### 3. Electrical Units (EU) & Power Grid
- **Electric Generators** produce $10\text{ EU/t}$ from solid fuels.
- **Solar Panels** (Copper $5\text{ EU/t}$, Steel $10\text{ EU/t}$, Exerion $20\text{ EU/t}$) generate clean daytime energy.
- **BatBox** buffers store up to $40.000\text{ EU}$ with directional input/output routing.
- **Electric Crushers** operate $5\times$ faster than manual crushers and accept **Speed** and **Efficiency Upgrades**.

### 4. Quantum & Dimensional Storage
- **Digital Storage Terminal:** Centralized interface that searches, indexes, and extracts items across all connected inventories.
- **Frequency Ender Chest & Tank:** Instantaneous cross-dimensional item and fluid transport synced to customizable frequency channels.

👉 *For full mechanical and electrical specifications, see [docs/MACHINES_AND_ENERGY.md](docs/MACHINES_AND_ENERGY.md).*

## 🧰 Equipment & Special Tools

- 🔧 **Wrench:** Right-click to rotate block faces. **Shift + Right-Click** to dismantle any machine instantly, keeping its inventory and energy charge intact.
- 🔍 **Era Scanner:** Inspects blocks and items in the world to determine their required era tier. Recharges inside an active Steam Turbine.
- 🥾 **Steam Boots:** High pneumatic jump dampeners that **negate 100% of fall damage**.
- 🪖 **Logic Helmet:** Integrated heads-up display providing night vision and tactical entity tracking.
- ⛏️ **Electric Mining Drill:** High-speed continuous subterranean tunneling tool.
- ⚔️ **Plasma Sword:** High-damage thermal blade that burns through hostile armor.

👉 *For the complete tools, armor and upgrade guide, see [docs/ITEMS_AND_EQUIPMENT.md](docs/ITEMS_AND_EQUIPMENT.md).*
